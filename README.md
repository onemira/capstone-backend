## Why Devvit :+1:


_Sharing Information_ is a great practice of developers. Throughout immersive code school, I have been shared of a great amount of resourceful materials in different types of data via Slack. However, searching for the previous information was always a hassle especially when the information was shared a while ago. In order to solve this clustered data problem and to save our data more practially and efficiently, I have developed this app with clearly-distinguished categories using with subjective org. schema.
