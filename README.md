## Why Devvit :+1:

_Sharing Information_ is a great practice of developers. Throughout immersive code school, we have been shared of a great amount of useful materials in different type of data via Slack. However, searching for the previous information was a hassle at the times like scrolling up and down and searching for random words. In order to solve this clustered data problem shared via Slack, I developed this website with clearly distinguished categories like drawers organize clothing into categories in a dresser.
